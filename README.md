## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MySQL** (version 8.0 or higher) - [Download here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
- **npm** or **pnpm** (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone or Download the Project

If you downloaded the ZIP file, extract it to your desired location.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd medical-inventory
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# OR using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up the Database

1. **Start your MySQL server** (usually through XAMPP, WAMP, or direct MySQL installation)

2. **Create a new database**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE medical_inventory;
   ```

3. **Run the setup script**:
   - Open your MySQL client (phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or command line)
   - Select the `medical_inventory` database
   - Import the `setup_database.sql` file located in the project root

   **Command line method**:
   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p medical_inventory < setup_database.sql
   ```

### 4. Configure Database Connection

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add your database configuration:

```env
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=medical_inventory

# Session Secret (change this to a random string)
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
```

**Important**: Replace `your_mysql_username` and `your_mysql_password` with your actual MySQL credentials.

### 5. Run the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# OR using pnpm
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at: **http://localhost:3000**

## Default Login Credentials

The database comes with a default admin account:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`

**⚠️ Important**: Change this password immediately after first login for security!

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

1. **Check MySQL is running**: Ensure your MySQL server is started
2. **Verify credentials**: Double-check your `.env.local` file
3. **Check database exists**: Make sure you created the `medical_inventory` database
4. **Port conflicts**: MySQL typically runs on port 3306

### Port Already in Use

If port 3000 is busy, Next.js will automatically try port 3001, 3002, etc. You can also specify a custom port:

```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### Module Not Found Errors

If you see import errors, try:

```bash
# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

## Need Help?

- Check the browser console for error messages
- Ensure all prerequisites are properly installed
- Verify your database connection and credentials
- Make sure the database schema was imported correctly
